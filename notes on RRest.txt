Recommendations
• Device design recommendations:
– Finger PPG rather than ear,
– Clinical equipment acceptable, and
– ECG superior to PPG
– ECG sampling frequency ≥ 250 Hz
– PPG sampling frequency ≥ 16 Hz
• Clinical considerations:
– FM-based PPG modulation reduced in elderly
– No differences between men and women
– Qualities of modulations reduced at higher BRs

6. Conclusion
We assessed the performances of 314 algorithms for estimation of RR from the ECG and PPG 
under ideal operating conditions including many novel algorithms. The top ranked method 
Physiol. Meas. 37 (2016) 610 P H Charlton et al
624
was X E B1,2,3 T4 FM1( ) ECG . Four algorithms performed better than IP, the current clinical standard for non-invasive RR measurement, when operating on the ECG. This suggests that ECGbased algorithms may perform sufficiently well for use in particular clinical scenarios.
The conclusions of this study can be used to inform the design of wearable sensors which 
incorporate an algorithm to estimate RR from the ECG or PPG. Firstly, algorithms were typically 
more precise when using the ECG than the PPG, suggesting that preference should be given to 
using the ECG to estimate RR. Secondly, we recommend using a time-domain RR estimation 
technique, rather than a frequency-domain technique, since the best-performing algorithms used 
time-domain techniques. Thirdly, we recommend using a modulation fusion technique to fuse 
estimates corresponding to the three respiratory modulations, for the same reason.
Future work is required to investigate the generalisability of these conclusions. In particular, it is important to determine whether algorithm performance is significantly influenced 
by artifact, recording equipment and subjects’ physiology.
This study provides a publicly available toolbox of algorithms and data to enable future 
authors to perform reproducible and easily-compared assessments of novel algorithms. 
The toolbox of algorithms and data is available at: http://peterhcharlton.github.io/RRest. We 
welcome developments to the existing code or contributions of new algorithms for inclusion 
in future versions of the toolkit







Real-time extraction of the respiratory rate from 
photoplethysmographic signals using wearable devices


The extraction of the respiratory rate from the PPG signal has been achieved by 
several methods. Most studies use the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) [10-12], but this 
requires a long time period to process the data. Digital filtering methods described by 
Nilsson et al. [13, 14] and Nakajima et al. [15], as well as the wavelet decomposition 
described by Addison et al. [16, 17], are other methods that have been used. Nilsson 
et al. proposed the use of a 3rd order Butterworth band-pass filter in their study, with 
a pass-band 0.1-0.3Hz, corresponding to 6-18 breaths per minute. They reported an 
average error of less than 0.5 breaths per minute. Addison et al. [16] developed a 
complex Matlab algorithm, using the wavelet transform to extract a breathing waveform from the PPG signal with an average error about 1 breath per minute. Better 
results have been obtained using an autoregressive (AR) modeling method [18], for 
which the mean error is 0.04.



Another approach presents the possibility of extracting respiratory information 
from derived PPG features, such as pulse width variability (PWV), pulse amplitude 
variability (PAV), pulse rate variability (PRV) and the PPG pulse envelope [2, 11,
19]. Lazaro et al. [19] presented in their paper a method to estimate the respiratory 
rate from PAV, PWV, and PRV using a spectrum-based algorithm [20]. The respiratory rate was extracted from the presented features independently, and also after a 
data fusion of these features [2, 19].

The respiratory rate modulates the PPG signal in three ways. For example, the 
pulse wave amplitude is affected by blood vessels flexibility. During expiration our 
blood vessels are more flexible than during inspiration [19]. Also, the intrathoracic 
pressure causes variation of pulse envelope and a decrease in cardiac output influ-
